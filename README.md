This is a series of samples on how to make an video player(video-only) using FFmpeg and the most basic rendering API available (GDI for C++ and Delphi\ WPF for CSharp).

Feel free to use this code as an example to build your own video player, however this code is only a sample with the intent to demonstrate the fundamentals of how video files work.
